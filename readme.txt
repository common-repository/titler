Titler is a powerful tool that gives you complete control over how good and relevant your titles looks. 

== Description ==

With Titler (aka WP Custom Headlines) you can make your post/page titles look almost however you wish, you can add images, links, etc.

Furthermore, with Titler's simple shortcode you can dynamically personalize and customize your titles depending on users/guests, time and other various parameters.  

**New in Version 1.5 :** Randomize text in your titles.

**On the current version, you can :**

* Completely redesign and restyle a Post/Page Title. 
* Dynamically Customize your title depending on the day/month/year.
* Dynamically Customize your title depending on the time that has passed since the post/page was published.
* Personalize the title depending on the user/guest.
* Dynamically Modify your titles according to exact dates (add a message for Valentine's, New Year,etc).
* Dynamically Modify your titles depending on the amount of comments in the post.
* Radnomize text in Title.
* Limit titler to Posts / Pages / Main Loop.


**Coming Soon :**

* Customize by the popularity of the post/page.
* Customize by specific users / a user's privileges.

The generated titles do not effect the post/page's URL or the readability of the post/page's title in the admin area. They only show when on the front end - and will always fallback to the default title in case of an error.
